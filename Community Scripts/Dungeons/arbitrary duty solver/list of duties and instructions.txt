note to reader:
please go ahead and steal the code etc.
would appreciate if you help to improve it and PR your .duty files.

--------------------------------------------
--------how to make a .duty file------------
--------------------------------------------
Make a script entry in SND with the following:
--zoneID
yield("/echo this is the zone/area ID = "..GetZoneID().." you can call the file "..GetZoneID()..".duty")
--basic line entry for the .duty file
yield("/echo 1,"..GetPlayerRawXPos()..","..GetPlayerRawYPos()..","..GetPlayerRawZPos()..",3")

Every duty file has a number of rows. each one has 6 columns separated by a comman (,) and no spaces between commmas and values.

Value 1: 0, 1 || movement type || 0 Visland, 1 = Vnavmesh
Value 2: x || get from above script
Value 3: y || get from above script
Value 4: z || get from above script
Value 5: t || seconds to wait after reaching waypoint before next waypoint trigger. default 3 seconds
Value 6: r || value 0 normall, anything above 0 otherwise.  Explanation: if we have gone through a sub area transition like the magitek armor in prae -> basement section,
we need to solve that. simply put in the appropriate value a few y lower than the distance to waypoint AFTER the area transition. the prae (1044.duty) preset has a few entries in it.


General tips:
use visland to get through area transitions
if you think navmesh might be weird around some messy corners, dont trust it implicitly and set some good spots it can reach or just use visland.
if the duty requires some weird stuff to proceed come to the disc and let's find a solution ill write the lua or you can and we can make it work.
some stuff isn't yet solved by bossmod but we can solve in SND for now
