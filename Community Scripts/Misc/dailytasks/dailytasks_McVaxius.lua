What is this ?

a kind of manager script that does various things based on certain rules, continually so you can just fire and forget it.

you fire up the script and hope it doesnt die at some point and it will do the following things nonstop while your afk

obviously it will return chars safely home to bell/fc entrance and resume autoretainer in between activities

maybe this would be better as a plugin not as a script.

******************************
Stuff I think is possible now
******************************
*check for certain FC buffs every 12 hours with a specific set of array of chars (in case you are managing multiple active FC)
*run cuff-a-cur for x hours a day at a specific time y on specific char with a base64 visland route to get to the machine
*run HOH intuition farm for x hours a day on a specific char
*run fishing every 2 hours on a rotating list of chars

************************************************************
I'm not sure if its possible or needs some slash commands?
************************************************************
*run TT for x3 hours a day at a specific time y on a specific char
*attempts to buys 5 stack of fuel @ any FC that is below x value. checks every 12 hours

****************************************************************************************************
Stuff that would be nice but technically annoying to do since we need more stuff for it to "happen"
****************************************************************************************************
*visit the personal island once a week and somehow do the island stuff and then leave
*play mini cactpot daily on a list of chars at y time
*play jumbo cactpot weekly on a list of chars at y time
*play verminion weekly on a list of chars at y time
